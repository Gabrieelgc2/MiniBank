### 1 Requirement – User Registration (/create) - POST
- Any person can open an account by providing basic data: name, CPF, address, email, and password.
- CPF must be unique (no duplication allowed).
- For each registration, a sequential account number is created.
- New accounts start with a bonus balance of R$ 50,00 to attract new clients.

E.g:
{
   "name" : "Teste1",
   "cpf" : "46326463120",
   "email" : "RodrigoPereira@Jequitinhonha",
   "address" : "teste",
   "password" : "teste2"
}
### 2 Requirement – Authentication (/login) - GET
- Once an account is created, the user must authenticate with their account number (sequentially created) and password.
- Managers can authenticate with the fixed account number "gerencia" and any fixed password; this user does not need to be actually registered in the database.

E.g:
For client
> 46326463120 and password: teste2
For manager
> manager and password: password
### 3 Requirement – Client: Account Balance and Transactions (/account/{id}/balance, /seeTransactions/numberAccount) - GET

E.g:
{
    "sourceAccount" : 207501,
    "destinationAccount" : 948937,
    "value" : 10
}
### 5 Requirement – Client: Loan Request (/loan) - POST
